## Data 
The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.

## Code 
The code is divided as follows: 
* The [train.py] python file contains the necessary code to run an experiement. 
* The [test.py] python file is used to evaluate the experiement. 
* The [cc_net_model.py] python file contains the model. 
* The [data] folder contains the the datasets.
* The [pth] folder contains the best model of the experiement. 

To run a model on one dataset you should issue the following command: 
```
python3 train.py 
python3 test.py
```
## Prerequisites
All python packages needed are listed in [pip-requirements.txt](https://github.com/hfawaz/dl-4-tsc/blob/master/utils/pip-requirements.txt) file and can be installed simply using the pip command. 
The code now uses Pytorch 1.9.0.
